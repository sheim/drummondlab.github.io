## Research Statement
In a broad sense, I'm interested in how nature solves optimality problems, in particular with regard to dynamics and locomotion.  
Human-engineered machines tend to systematically outperform nature's solutions only for a small set of cases, namely when the dynamics can be accurately captured by a linear model. Otherwise, animals tend to move more gracefully, efficiently and robustly in spite of, or perhaps _because of_, rather complex non-linear dynamics involved.

I believe this performance is achieved by properly exploiting rather than overcoming the non-linear dynamics. To this end, it is important to both design a controller that properly exploits the _natural dynamics_, as well as design the mechanical system such that it's dynamics are easily exploitable.

## Short Biography
 I completed my BSc degree in Mechanical Engineering and my MSc in Robotics, Systems and Control at ETH Zurich. During this time I spent a semester at TU Delft and conducted my master thesis at the [BioRob lab][http://biorob.epfl.ch/] of prof. [Auke Ijspeert](http://biorob.epfl.ch/people/ijspeert) at EPFL.

## Other Interests
I enjoy photography, music (mostly fingerstyle acoustic guitar) and playing [go](http://senseis.xmp.net/?WhatIsGo) (囲碁).
